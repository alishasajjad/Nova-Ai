"""
Desktop Automation Module

Provides higher-level helpers for common Windows desktop actions used by Atlas,
such as opening the Recycle Bin, launching websites, and performing basic
system power operations (sleep, shutdown, restart).

All functions are best-effort and wrapped in try/except so that failures never
crash the main application – they simply return an error message that can be
spoken back to the user.
